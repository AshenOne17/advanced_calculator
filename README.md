# Advanced Calculator Omega

This program has **4 different modes**:
- Arithmetic calculations (+, -, *, /).
- Trigonometry calculations (sin(), cos(), tg(), ctg())
- ~~Exponential calculations (power(), root())~~
- ~~Logarithmic calculations (log(), ln())~~

The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and provides a user-friendly interface for conducting calculations. The code is written in C++ and utilizes object-oriented programming techniques, making it easy to expand and maintain in the future. Using templates as well. Minimal markdown for making the interface user-friendly. Looking forward into the future to add possibility of complex calculations, extra error handling, calculation on different unit measures, etc.
